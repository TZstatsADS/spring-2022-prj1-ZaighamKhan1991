### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: Philosphy Finder
+ This project is conducted by Zaigham Ali Khan

+ Project summary: [a short summary] Philosphy has seen many eccentric and world-changing personalities. From the time humans have started recording history, we have written
accounts of their writings, sayings and written thoughts. The school of philosphy has changed with time. We have different schools of
thoughts of ancient times, popularized by the philosphers like Plato and Aristotle. However, as times grew and the focus of humans shifted
from monarchies to democracies, new schools of thoughts like capitalism and communism grew. In this project my focus is to analyze
different schools of thoughts, identify the underlying 'topics' in different schools of thoughts and predict some articles as to which school of
thought they align with.
