## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
phil_data<-read.csv('C://Users/Devika/Documents/Columbia/Term 2/Applied Data Science/Github/spring-2022-prj1-ZaighamKhan1991/data/philosophy_data.csv')
```

```{r,setup}
install.packages("reticulate")
library(reticulate)
```


```{python}
import pandas as pd
phil_data.head()
```




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
