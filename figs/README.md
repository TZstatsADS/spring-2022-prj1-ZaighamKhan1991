# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the history of philosophy

### Figs folder

The figs directory contains the figures. This directory contains pictures of top words in the topics generated for each philosphy. 
Analysing different schools gives an insight into the basic philosphy of each school. Plato and Aristotle's writings are more about men and understanding. 
Rationalists' writing are more about good and evil and love, whereas feminists writing are about women and workers etc. 
The figures also contain timeline of different philosphers and schools. Note that one philospher has been mentioned more than once, depending on the times their accounts are from. It is also important to note that some dates are not parsed by python and hence philosphers before 1000 AD are not shown above. This timeline gives some insights about the eras of philosphers. It shows that Descartes was active before 1650 and Hume came a century later. It precisely captures the arrival of Smith and Hime. The graph also depicts the modern authors like Lewis and Kripke.
This timeline gives some insights about the rise of ideas in different eras. Rationalism nad Empricism Were popular schools in the medieval eras. However, the 1800s witnessed many philospers with german idealism. It is interesting to note that first world war happened after 100 years of german idealism. Could it have led the germans into a sense of pride and nationalism which resulted in war? German idealism is followed by other popular schools like capitalism and communism. The modern era philosphers have shifted more towards analytic schools.
